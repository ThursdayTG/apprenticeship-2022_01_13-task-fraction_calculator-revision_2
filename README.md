So, why did I rewrite this?

First of all, because there was another task that I had not solved, but before I did that, I simply wanted to clean things up. That was the initial motivator for me. However, this quickly turned into an exercise in working with multiple files, adhering to Semantic Versioning, and using Git. I am very happy with what I have learned while working on this project, and I have started getting more accustomed with GitKraken. By the time of writing this, I have yet to grow accustomed to how branches are normally used, but I reckon that should not be very challenging.
