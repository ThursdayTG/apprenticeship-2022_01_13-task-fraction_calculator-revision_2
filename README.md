# apprenticeship-2022_01_13-task-fraction_calculator-revision_2

In my apprenticeship, we were tasked to create a fraction calculator after being taught about functions. Had some good fun with it, decided I want to continue work on it for leisure as this has turned into my most complex project thus far.

**TODO:**
 - make functions for calculations actually do fraction calculations instead of having them rely entirely on floats
 - implement fractions as structs
