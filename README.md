So, why did I rewrite this?

First of all, because there was another task that I had not solved, but before I did that, I simply wanted to clean things up. That was the initial motivator for me. However, this quickly turned into an exercise in working with multiple files, adhering to Semantic Versioning, and using Git. I am very happy with what I have learned while working on this project, and I have started getting more accustomed with GitKraken. By the time of writing this, I have yet to grow accustomed to how branches are normally used, but I reckon that should not be very challenging. I'm guessing that this may also help me with getting started with properly documenting the changes I'm making with every update.

Btw, managing local Git repos and managing GitHub are honestly two quite different beasts. I do not yet dare to use GitKraken or the CLI to manage both simultaneously, because my local repos still tend to be somewhat chaotic at times, and by managing local and remote repos separately, I can ~~occasionally~~ keep things a bit cleaner on GitHub. Speaking of managing GitHub separately, it took me *waaay*  too long to find out that uploading files with the same filename in the same path can save me the hassle of manually editing or deleting each file.
